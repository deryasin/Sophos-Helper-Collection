## Intro
These little helper scripts were developed for specific use-case scenarios. They are not fully tested for every scenario.

I take no responsibility for their use.
These scripts were likely created for single-use cases and have not been thoroughly tested.
I try to document the use case and known issues, but, as mentioned, I guarantee nothing.
