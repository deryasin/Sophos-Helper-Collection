## Intro
These little helper scripts were developed for specific use-case scenarios. They are not fully tested for every scenario.
I take no responsibility for their use.
I try to document the use case and known issues, but, as mentioned, I guarantee nothing.

## Scripts
### add_networks.py
### download_rules.py
### reverse_access_updater.py
### rule_search.py
